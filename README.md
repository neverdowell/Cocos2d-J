# Cocos2d-J
Java implementation of Cocos2D. 
This implementation is NOT an official Cocos2d implementation! It's just a side project to enable pupils to develop games in Java at school. Time between commits will be varying a lot, since it's planned to be final in about a year. Interfaces will be (more or less) the same as in Cocos2d-X


Future plans
First version will render using awt instead of openGL for simplier implementation purpose at the beginning.
Importers for SpriteBuilder, Tiled, other Editors and atlas-maps are planned.
